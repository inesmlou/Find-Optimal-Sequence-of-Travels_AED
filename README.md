# Graph-travel_AED

Project for the course of Algorithms and Data Structures.

The goal is to develop a travel agent, that determines and recommends the best route and the necessary transports that a client should take from go to one city to another.
The program should return the optimal sequence of cities that should be visited as well as which transport to use between each one of them.
The optimiality criteria can be either minimizing the total travel time or the total travel cost.
